Admin Portal Development — Basic to Advanced Enhancements

Implemented a secure and fully functional login system.

Resolved the issue where users could access all pages without authentication; ensured proper redirects based on login status.

Fixed the logout issue on the student page.

Resolved multiple console errors to improve overall stability.

Fixed a hydration mismatch problem caused by layout.jsx accessing localStorage during server-side rendering.

Corrected routing behavior so that unauthenticated users are always redirected to the login page, preventing unauthorized access.

Volunteer Portal Development — Basic to Advanced Enhancements

Fix scanner page - backend returns 'action: ENTRY/EXIT' not 'status: IN/OUT'
Fix success page - handleLogout missing closing brace and type check should match backend

Fix dashboard history - backend returns 'scanned_at' not 'time'

GET /volunteer/profile — Working
POST /volunteer/scan/student — Fixed to match response structure
